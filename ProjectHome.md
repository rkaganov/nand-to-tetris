The project involved building a modern computer from nand gates step by step, starting from simple sequential and combinational circuits all the way to computer architecture, assembler, virtual machine layer, compiler for an object-oriented language called jack and finally the operating system written in jack language.

Value add: Gained hands-on experience in chip simulation and testing, ALU/CPU design and implementation, and design of a simple assembler, a stack-based virtual machine, a top-down compiler for an object oriented language and operating system functionalities like memory and I/O handling.
